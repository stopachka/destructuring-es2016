Like many C-like programming languages, most operators JavaScript are binary or
unary, and written in infix notation, i.e. `a op b`.

Here is list of typical operations:

- **Assignment**: `foo = bar`, assigns the value of the <abbr title="Left Hand 
Side">lhs</abbr> to the <abbr title="Right Hand Side">shs</abbr>.

- **Math**: `a + b`, `a - b`, `a * b`, `a / b`

- **String concatenation:** `a + b`

- **Boolean:** `a && b`, `a || b`, `!a`

- **Bitwise:** `a & b`, `a | b`, `a ^ b`

- **Function calls**: `foo()`, `foo(a, b, c)`

- **Shorthands**: `a += 1`, `i++`

- **Conditional**: `foo ? bar : baz`

JavaScript also has *comparison* operators and *property accessors*,
both of which are explained in more detail in the next slides.
